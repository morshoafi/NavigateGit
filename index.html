            What is coffee … other than the beverage of choice for people with excellent taste, that is.
            <br>
            An even more accurate question might be what is coffee made of? Coffee beans, sure – but did you know those are actually seeds found inside the cherries (also called the fruit) of coffee trees? They grow in more than 40 countries around the world, and when dried, roasted, and ground, the seeds are used to brew coffee.
